    <h3> What Do We Do In The Class?</h3>
    <p> In my academy we use programs such as CodeHS and Code Academy to learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. We do activities where we have to follow what the teacher does on the promethean board and he explains what we have to do and how we do each thing. Then we usually work on CodeHS or we currently have to make a website where we have to follow a rubric to recive our grade. That is what we do in the class.</p>
